# Internet of Things: Raspberry Pi as a wireless remote outlets controller

In this personal project, I used Raspberry Pi, a credit card size computer, to simulate a wireless outlet controller. There are many applications of using a programmable computer to control the ON/OFF of outlets. For example, we can schedule the light to be opened in the early morning to wake us up. We can easily open/close the light when we are laying on the bed using a mobile phone. Moreover, we can remotely control electronics using any devices connected to the Internet when we are away from them. The programmable controller based on Raspberry Pi gives more flexibility than a traditional remote controller. This prototype demonstrated that a Raspberry Pi can be extended to support the solution of smart home applications.
